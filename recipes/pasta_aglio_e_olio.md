**Pasta Aglio e Olio (with Garlic and Oil)**  
*Serves 4*

**1 pound dried spaghetti**  
**¾ cup extra-virgin olive oil**  
**12 large garlic cloves**, cut into thin slivers  
**2 teaspoons crushed red pepper**, plus more for serving  
**Kosher salt and black pepper **  
**⅓ cup fresh parsley**, finely chopped  
**½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese**, plus more for serving  
**2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice**, plus lemon wedges for serving

 

1\. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and add the spaghetti,
cooking until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain, reserving a little of
the pasta water.

2\. Meanwhile, in a large pan, heat the olive oil. Add the garlic and
cook over moderate heat, stirring frequently, until golden brown. Add
the crushed red pepper and season with salt and pepper. Add the drained
spaghetti to the pan and toss, adding a little of the pasta water, until
the spaghetti is thoroughly coated.

3\. Remove the pan from heat, add the parsley and Parmesan and toss
well. Check for flavor, adding more salt if necessary. Add the lemon
juice, garnish with more Parmesan and serve with lemon wedges and
crushed red pepper.
