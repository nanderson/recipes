**Paleo All-Morning Energy Bars**

 

WHY THIS RECIPE WORKS

It can be hard to find granola bars that are paleo-friendly because so
many are made with oats, grains, and refined sugars. We wanted a
portable snack that was easy to make and contained only whole,
nutritious ingredients. A hearty collection of healthy nuts and seeds
provided the basis for our homemade bars. Toasting the nuts and seeds
before pulsing them in the food processor gave our bars a pleasant
roasted flavor, and the moderate heat of a 300-degree oven ensured that
they all toasted evenly without burning. Dates and maple syrup not only
added satisfying sweetness to the bars, but also aided in binding the
bars together. We found that processing some of the dates with the maple
syrup, warm water, and an egg white gave the bars a slight chew while
still allowing the nuts and seeds to remain crisp. We stirred the
remaining chopped dates into the mixture for textural contrast; tasters
also liked the little bursts of sweetness. The final step in perfecting
our homemade “granola” bars was to ensure they were evenly baked. After
baking the nut and seed mixture in an 8-inch square baking pan, we cut
it into bars while it was still warm (which made cutting clean lines
much easier), spread the bars out on a baking sheet, and returned them
to the oven to finish baking. The result: Evenly toasted bars with lots
of crunch and a slight chew that made a perfect, energy-packed snack. Be
sure not to overcook the nuts and seeds in step 2; they will continue to
toast while the bars bake.

INSTRUCTIONS

MAKES 10 BARS

**1.** Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 300 degrees.
Make foil sling for 8-inch square baking pan by folding 2 long sheets of
aluminum foil so each is 8 inches wide. Lay sheets of foil in pan
perpendicular to each other, with extra foil hanging over edges of pan.
Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing foil flush to pan,
and grease foil.

**2.** Spread almonds, cashews, pepitas, sunflower seeds, flax seeds,
and sesame seeds onto ­aluminum foil–lined rimmed baking sheet. Bake,
stirring occasionally, until pale golden and fragrant, 15 to 20 minutes.
Transfer nut mixture to food processor, let cool slightly, then pulse
until coarsely chopped, about 5 pulses; transfer to large bowl.

**3.** Process 1/4 cup dates, warm water, maple syrup, egg white, and
salt in now-empty processor until smooth, about 30 seconds, scraping
down sides of bowl as needed. Stir processed date mixture and remaining
1/4 cup chopped dates into nut mixture until well combined. Spread
mixture into prepared pan and press firmly into even layer using greased
metal spatula. Bake bars until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes, rotating
pan halfway through baking. Do not turn off oven.

**4.** Let bars cool in pan for 15 minutes. Using foil sling, remove
bars from pan, transfer to cutting board, and cut into 10 bars. Space
bars evenly on parchment paper–lined baking sheet and bake until deep
golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let bars cool on wire rack to room
temperature, about 1 hour. (Bars can be stored at room temperature for
up to 1 week.) Serve.
