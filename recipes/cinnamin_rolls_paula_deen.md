==============================

Total Time: 1 hr 50 min Yield:12 to 15 servings  
  
**Dough**:

-   1/4 -ounce package yeast

-   1/2 cup warm water

-   1/2 cup scalded milk

-   1/4 cup sugar

-   1/3 cup butter or shortening

-   1 teaspoon salt

-   1 egg

-   3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour

**Filling**:

-   1/2 cup melted butter, plus more for pan

-   3/4 cup sugar, plus more for pan

-   2 tablespoons ground cinnamon

-   3/4 cup raisins, walnuts, or pecans, optional

**Glaze**:

-   4 tablespoons butter

-   2 cups powdered sugar

-   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

-   3 to 6 tablespoons hot water

**Directions**  
Heat oven to 350 degrees F.

In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water and set aside. In a large
bowl mix milk, sugar, melted butter, salt and egg. Add 2 cups of flour
and mix until smooth. Add yeast mixture. Mix in remaining flour until
dough is easy to handle. Knead dough on lightly floured surface for 5 to
10 minutes. Place in well-greased bowl, cover and let rise until doubled
in size, usually 1 to 1 1/2 hours.

When doubled in size, punch down dough. Roll out on a floured surface
into a 15 by 9-inch rectangle. Spread melted butter all over dough. Mix
sugar and cinnamon and sprinkle over buttered dough. Sprinkle with
walnuts, pecans, or raisins if desired. Beginning at the 15-inch side,
role up dough and pinch edge together to seal. Cut into 12 to 15 slices.

Coat the bottom of baking pan with butter and sprinkle with sugar. Place
cinnamon roll slices close together in the pan and let rise until dough
is doubled, about 45 minutes. Bake for about 30 minutes or until nicely
browned.

Meanwhile, mix butter, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Add hot water 1
tablespoon at a time until the glaze reaches desired consistency. Spread
over slightly cooled rolls.
