**Ingredients**  
Caesar Salad Dressing:

-   6 cloves garlic, mashed and minced

-   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard

-   1 tablespoon vinegar

-   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

-   2 tablespoons mayonnaise

-   1/2 cup olive oil

-   1 teaspoon paprika

-   1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper

-   Romaine lettuce, for serving

-   Freshly grated Parmesan, for serving

**Directions**  
For the Caesar salad dressing: Combine the garlic, mustard, vinegar and
two pinches of salt in a blender and mix thoroughly. Add the mayonnaise
and blend together to form a thick base. In a slow stream add the olive
oil through the hole in lid. Scrape the dressing with spatula into a
bowl and season to taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice. If desired,
add some anchovy to the dressing to create a deeper, saltier taste.

For the Caesar salad croutons: Cut the baguette into cubes. Melt the
butter in a skillet and add the garlic powder, paprika and pepper. Add
the bread cubes and saut√© just until the bread cubes begin to brown. Set
aside to cool.

Wash and dry the lettuce. In a large salad bowl, combine the lettuce,
dressing and croutons. Top with freshly grated Parmesan. Toss gently to
combine well.
