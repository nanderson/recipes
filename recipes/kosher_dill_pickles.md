Tips
====

**Crispiness**

> *Calcium chloride “pickle crisp” will keep the pickles firm and
> crispy.*

**Additions**

> *Add dried chili peppers, habanero peppers, whole peppercorns, onion
> slices, carrots or other veggies. Garlic may turn blue or green in the
> jar. Nothing to be alarmed about, it is only the effect of the acid on
> the natural pigments in the garlic*

**Salt**

> *Pickling salt is free of the additives found in table salt, which can
> discolor homemade pickles. If you use regular table salt, the pickles
> will taste fine, but they may turn dark, with cloudy liquid. Do not
> substitute kosher salt, as the difference in texture can result in
> incorrect measurements.*

**Sourness**

> *The proportion of water to vinegar necessary to inhibit the growth of
> organisms produces a very sour pickle. While you can't change this
> proportion, you can safely add up to one tablespoon of sugar if you
> want to slightly sweeten the pickles.*
