**The Only Texas Chili Recipe You’ll Ever Need**

**Serves 8 to 10**

12 ancho chiles, stems and seeds removed  
7 pasilla chiles, stems and seeds removed  
2 1/2 tablespoons cumin seeds, toasted, then ground  
1 tablespoon whole coriander seeds, toasted, then ground  
1 1/2 tablespoons dried Mexican oregano  
2 teaspoons unsweetened cocoa  
1 1/2 tablespoons sweet Hungarian paprika  
1/2 teaspoon cayenne  
2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper  
6 pounds beef chuck roast  
1/3 cup fresh leaf lard (preferable) or shortening  
2 large onions, chopped  
15 garlic cloves, minced  
2/3 cup tomato paste  
1 can (15 ounces) tomato sauce  
3 quarts chicken stock (set aside 2/3 cup for the masa harina)  
1/2 cup masa harina whisked into 2/3 cup hot chicken stock  
kosher salt

*Heat a heavy-bottomed 12- to 14-inch skillet over medium-high heat.
When the pan is hot, add a layer of the chiles. Cook, turning often,
until a strong chile aroma—one that is not bitter or charred—emanates
from the pan. Do not allow the chiles to burn. Spread the chiles on a
wire rack to cool and become moderately crisp. Repeat until all the
chiles have been toasted. Grind the chiles to a fine powder in an
electric spice or coffee grinder. Shake the chile powder through a fine
strainer to remove any large pieces. Combine the ground chiles with the
cumin, coriander, oregano, cocoa, paprika, cayenne, and black pepper.
Set the mixture aside.*

*Trim the chuck roast, removing all fat, gristle, and tendons. Chop the
meat by hand into 1/2-inch dice; set aside. Melt the lard in a
heavy-bottomed 8-quart (or larger) Dutch oven over medium-high heat.
When the fat is hot, add the meat and sear, stirring often. Add the
onions and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until the onions are wilted and
transparent, about 7 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir to blend
well. Cook, stirring, until the tomato paste is thick and dark in color,
about 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and chile-spice mixture. Stir to
blend well, then add the chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a full
boil, then lower heat to a simmer and cover. Cook, stirring
occasionally, for about 1 1/2 hours. Stir in the masa mixture and salt
to taste. Cook, uncovered, an additional 30 to 45 minutes on low-medium
heat, or until the chili is thickened and the meat is fork-tender. Stir
often to prevent sticking. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired. Serve
hot and add your favorite toppings (diced onion, avocado, sour cream,
shredded cheese, corn chips, et cetera).*
