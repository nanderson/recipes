These crunchy baguettes feature a chewy interior riddled with holes, and
a crisp, deep-gold crust. While it's a challenge to make "real"
baguettes at home, this version is probably as close to an artisan
bakery version as you're going to find. And hey, all you vegans out
there: this is probably my favorite vegan recipe. It's beautiful in the
utter simplicity of its ingredients.  
  
**Our guarantee:** These baguettes, right out of the oven, will have a
crunchy crust; later, the crust will become chewy. They'll be a deep
golden brown, about 16" long, and 1 3/4" to 2 1/2" in diameter.

**Starter**

-   113g cool water

-   1/16 teaspoon active dry yeast or [<u>instant
    yeast</u>](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/detail.jsp?id=1458)

-   120g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour or [<u>Organic Bread
    Flour</u>](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/detail.jsp?id=3585)

**Dough**

-   1 teaspoon active dry yeast or [<u>instant
    yeast</u>](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/detail.jsp?id=1458)

-   227 to 283g lukewarm water\*

-   all of the starter

-   418g [<u>King Arthur Unbleached Bread
    Flour</u>](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/detail.jsp?id=3001) or
    Organic Bread Flour

-   1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons salt, to taste

-   \*Use the lesser amount in summer (or in a humid environment), the
    greater amount in winter (or in a dry climate), and somewhere in
    between the rest of the year, or if your house is climate
    controlled.

**Directions**

1.  Make the starter by mixing the yeast with the water (no need to do
    > this if you're using instant yeast), then mixing in the flour to
    > make a soft dough. Cover and let rest at room temperature for
    > about 14 hours; overnight works well. The starter should have
    > risen and become bubbly. If it hasn't, your yeast may not be
    > working. Dissolve 1/4 teaspoon of yeast in 1 tablespoon lukewarm
    > water with a pinch of sugar, and wait 15 minutes. If nothing
    > happens, replace your yeast, and begin the starter process again.

2.  If you're using active dry yeast, mix it with the water, then
    > combine with the starter, flour, and salt. If you're using instant
    > yeast, there's no need to combine it with the water first. Mix and
    > knead everything together—by hand, mixer or bread machine set on
    > the dough cycle—till you've made a soft, somewhat smooth dough; it
    > should be cohesive, but the surface may still be a bit rough.
    > Knead for about 5 minutes on speed 2 of a stand mixer

3.  Place the dough in a lightly greased medium-size bowl, cover the
    > bowl, and let the dough rise for 3 hours, gently deflating it and
    > turning it over after 1 hour, and then again after 2 hours.  
    >   
    > 4) Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide
    > it into three equal pieces.  
    >   
    > 5) Shape each piece into a rough, slightly flattened oval, cover
    > with greased plastic wrap, and let them rest for 15 minutes.

4.  Working with one piece of dough at a time, fold the dough in half
    > lengthwise, and seal the edges with the heel of your hand. Flatten
    > it slightly, and fold and seal again.

5.  With the seam-side down, cup your fingers and gently roll the dough
    > into a 15" log. Place the logs seam-side down into the wells of a
    > baguette pan; or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined sheet
    > pan or pans.\*

6.  Cover them with a cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow
    > the loaves to rise till they've become very puffy, about 1 1/2
    > hours.  
    >   
    > 9) Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 450°F;
    > if you're using a baking stone, place it on the lowest rack.

7.  Using a very sharp knife held at about a 45° angle, make three 8"
    > vertical slashes in each baguette. Spritz the baguettes heavily
    > with warm water; this will help them develop a crackly-crisp
    > crust.

8.  Bake the baguettes until they're a very deep golden brown, 25 to 30
    > minutes. Remove them from the oven and cool on a rack. Or, for the
    > very crispiest baguettes, turn off the oven, crack it open about
    > 2", and allow the baguettes to cool in the oven.  
    >   
    > Yield: Three 16" baguettes.

9.  **\*Advanced baker version:** Place the shaped baguettes, seam-side
    > down, in the folds of a heavily floured cotton dish towel. Allow
    > them to rise as directed. When fully risen, gently roll them onto
    > a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet, floured side
    > down. Bake as directed. Or roll them onto a baker's peel, and then
    > onto a heated pizza stone in the oven. Bake as directed above.

10. **Variation:** Make six stuffed sandwiches, perfect for picnics or
    > lunchboxes.

11. **Stuffed Baguettes**  
    > Divide the baguette dough into six pieces instead of three, and
    > shape each into a 5"-long rectangle.

12. Layer with your favorite filling; we like mustard, ham, and Swiss
    > cheese. Don't use too much filling, as it'll make the baguettes
    > soggy. Also, use a dry filling (e.g., sliced deli meat, cheese)
    > rather than something wet like meatballs in sauce.

13. Roll up like a jelly roll, sealing the long seam and pinching the
    > ends closed.

14. Place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, and
    > allow to rest for 15 to 20 minutes until just slightly puffy.

15. Slash each baguette twice lengthwise, if desired. The cheese will
    > ooze out. Some people like this look; some don't. Your choice.

16. Bake until golden brown, as directed above. You may need shorten the
    > baking time a bit from the original recipe.
