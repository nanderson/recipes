**Challah**

From Ebis, modified for Texas climate and altitude.

**Ingredients**

-   butter

-   1 packets of yeast

-   2 eggs

-   1/6 cup oil

-   1 cups water

-   1/2 tbs salt

-   1.5 TBS sugar

-   1/6 cup honey, sugar or agave

-   Flour – about 3.5 cups

**Instructions**

Dissolve one packet of yeast & 1.5 TBS sugar in 1/2 cup of warm water. I
do this right in the bowl of my mixer.

15-20 minutes later it’s ALIVE! Bubbling and frothy.

Time to start mixing in all the other stuff. I like to alternate between
the wet and dry ingredients which include:

> 1 egg
>
> 1/6 cup oil
>
> 1/2 cup water
>
> 1/5 tbs salt
>
> 1/6 cup sugar (you can sub honey or agave)
>
> Flour – about 3.5 cups but I don’t really measure. I just keep adding
> till I get the right consistency, which is barely sticky and gooey,
> and a little “springy”.

That dough hook really makes me look good. It does all the work for me.
In just a few minutes, all the ingredients are incorporated, and the
dough comes together in a ball.

When the dough is done. Place it in a very well buttered bowl, covered
with a damp cloth or paper towel and leave it to rise for an hour or so.

> Best to leave in an area that is a little warm, like on a stove with a
> pilot light (but not a flame). Or Outside. Or in the bathroom with the
> shower on hot.
>
> Check it out. It really grows!

Now cut to 3 or 4 even pieces and braid the challah.

After you braid your challah, let it rise a little more for half an hour
or so, covered with a damp cloth.

Preheat your oven to 365 degrees.

Brush your challah with one fully beaten egg.

Bake for 25-30 minutes and remove from oven.
