Instructions
------------

1.  Drizzle the chicken with the oil and sprinkle on the garam masala,
    curry powder, salt and pepper. Massage into the meat and cover,
    marinate for at least 2 hours or overnight.

2.  Heat a grill pan over medium-high heat. Grill the chicken for 5-6
    minutes per side, until cooked through.

3.  Meanwhile, make the sauce: place the onions, garlic, and 1 cup of
    water in the bowl of a blender. Puree until smooth.

4.  Measure out the spices (curry powder through cumin) into a small
    bowl.

5.  In a large saucepan heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium
    heat. Once the oil is shimmering, add the pureed onion mixture and
    cook for a 2-3 minutes, stirring constantly, until it begins to
    darken in color.

6.  Add the tomatoes, ginger, ground almonds, coconut milk, yogurt, red
    chili, pre-measured spices, and brown sugar. Stir well.

7.  Turn the heat down to low and simmer 30 minutes. Cut the chicken
    into bite-sized pieces and add to the pan; simmer for an additional
    15 minutes. Serve with steamed basmati rice and/or naan.
