Limoncello

**Ingredients**

2 (750 ml) bottles high proof, grain alcohol (Everclear)

Zest of 14 lemons

4 ½ cups sugar

1 ½ liters water

 

**Directions**

In a 5 quart, round-mouthed glass jar, combine the alcohol
and lemon zest.  Tightly seal the jar and store it in darkness for 2
weeks.

 

Strain the alcohol into a large pot, discard the lemon zest, then return
the infused alcohol to the large jar.

 

In a 4 quart pot, combine sugar and the 1 ½ liters water.  Bring to a
soft boil, stirring occasionally until the sugar is dissolved.  Set
aside for 1 hour to cool.

 

Add the sugar water to the jar with the infused alcohol and seal
tightly.  If you notice sugar deposits at the bottom of the jar, shake
it gently.  Store in darkness again,

for 1 month.

 

Transfer to small bottles and served will chilled in shot glasses. 
Limoncello is best kept in the freezer until ready to serve.

**Hints**

-   Juice the lemons and freeze the juice in ice cube trays.  When
    frozen, transfer to a Ziploc bag.  Great in drinks or for lemonade.

-   Save unique, small whiskey bottles to pour the Limoncello into. 
    This makes great gifts.
